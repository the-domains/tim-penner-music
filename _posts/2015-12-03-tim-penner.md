Canadian born Tim Penner's experience working in the electronic music industry has afforded him a unique perspective on the production process. Driven by a passion to derive innovative sounds from the manipulation of frequencies, Penner has been able to generate a unique style loosely based upon the blending of themes inherent in the techno, house and trance arenas. Genre-defying in its classification, his work has graced a host of leading record labels and regularly supported by such luminaries as Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren, Above & Beyond, Guy J, and Matt Darey. Furthermore, a clutch of production credits can be found upon the Konstrukt imprint, run alongside Brazilian supremo, DNYO. In tandem, the duo has formed a highly impressive roster and release schedule.

â€‹With a successful hand in the electronic music industry, Tim also balances his skills with music designed for the TV, film, and video game industry. He specializes in wide atmospheric sounds, epic percussive builds, and intense ochestral soundscapes. His music takes on magnificent and unique shape to create extraordinarily imaginative pieces that, when paired with the right visual element, will captivate audiences beyond words.

"We're in an era beyond simply making songs. We're venturing into a brand new world of true audio manipulation. Music is made of frequencies that create the soundtrack to our lives. If you can harness this concept through technology, you can innovate rather than imitate." -Tim
